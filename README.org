#+TITLE: DarkLimericks

* Development

Requires [[https://github.com/tachyons-css/tachyons/][Tachyons CSS]]. There is a symlink in ~web/resources/public~ to the pre-built ~tachyons.css~ and ~tachyons.min.css~ found in the repo.

Build ~.jar~ with ~clojure -X:depstart uberjar :jar prhyme.jar~.

* TODO

** Use tightly packed trie for limerick generation

** Move limerick-specific code into this repo from Prhyme.

Or maybe into its own repo.
